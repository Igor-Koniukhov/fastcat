                        <p>Everyone gets hungry, get the pizzas and sandwiches at their place in no time.</p>
                        <p>By offering fast and reliable delivery which the customer can track on their phone, FastCat
                            has seen revenue growth of over 650% year on year. Restaurants who partner with us see their
                            revenue increase by up to 30%, creating thousands of jobs in the restaurant sector.</p>
                        <p>At FasCat, our values are at the core of everything we do. They guide how we work together
                            and make decisions, whether it be recruitment or the evolution and development of our
                            people, teams and products.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Customers</span></h2>
                        <p>FastCat is on a mission to transform the way customers eat. A key ingredient of our success
                            is having the best selection of popular restaurants to choose from. Whether people want a
                            pad Thai in the evening, a salad at lunch, or freshly scrambled eggs for breakfast - weâ€™ve
                            got it covered.</p>

                        <p>By constantly innovating and expanding, we offer the best choice and convenience. Our aim is
                            to bring great food direct to customers as fast as possible, in less than 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Adipisci dolorem illo
                            laboriosam.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Driven by technology</span></h2>
                        <p>FasCat was founded in the Ukraine and we are proud to export Ukrainian-borsh :) technology
                            around
                            the world. Our â€˜Frankâ€™ algorithm is based on powerful predictive technology that evaluates
                            the
                            most efficient way of distributing orders based on the location of restaurants, riders and
                            customers.</p>
                        <p>Machine learning helps to predict the time it will take to prepare a meal, helping to
                            streamline the delivery experience. FastCat has already cut delivery time by 20%, meaning
                            riders are able to complete more deliveries per hour and increase their earnings,
                            restaurants are able to increase their sales, and â€“ of course â€“ customers get their food
                            even faster.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Working with our riders</span></h2>
                        <p>FastCat is proud to offer well-paid, flexible work and our riders are at the heart of all
                            that we do. Their hard work powers our growth, and without them we would be unable to bring
                            our customers the best food on demand while helping great local restaurants to grow.</p>
                        <p>FastCat cares about our riders, and thatâ€™s why we were the first on-demand company to call
                            for an end to the trade-off between flexibility and security that currently exists in
                            employment law. We want to work with Governments in all countries to make this happen</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Amazing restaurants, delivered</span></h2>
                        <p>FastCat is passionate about food and bringing people evermore choice. There are amazing
                            restaurants everywhere that we believe everyone should have access to.</p>
                        <p>But FastCatâ€™s mission is not only to make sure that the restaurants in your area are
                            available to you when and where you want them - we want to go further and bring new
                            restaurants to your area so you have even more choice of amazing food.</p>
                        <p>FastCatâ€™s Editions platform does exactly that: helping restaurants expand to new areas.
                            Editions identifies the cuisines that people want but do not have access to locally and then
                            invests in restaurants who excel in those foods to help them set-up in those local
                            areas.</p>
                        <p> We help restaurants to set up kitchens in new areas within just 8-12 weeks, without the
                            upfront costs of a high-street premise. FastCat provides restaurants with data insights so
                            that they know which cuisines will be popular in specific local areas - meaning restaurants
                            grow faster and customers have wider choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether it is a local restaurant looking to expand, street food entrepreneurs seeking new
                            customers, or a restaurant wanting to launch a new menu, Editions is designed to support
                            innovation.</p>
                        <p>All this is what lies behind FastCatâ€™s mission to bring customers a whole world of
                            restaurant-quality food. Every consumerâ€™s version of amazing is different, and our job is to
                            ensure that they enjoy what they want, when they want it, where they want it.</p>
